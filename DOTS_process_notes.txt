Guide on creating DOTS game:

First step: Create the GUI (Graphical User Interface)

	> Needs 4 separate screens

		>> Welcome Screen

		>> Game Setup Screen

		>> Game Result Screen

		>> Report Screen

	> Needs Navigation tabs (File, Help, etc.)

Notes on combo boxes:
	> These are a bit trickier than expected. Created a 2nd sheet called 'Lists'
	  and made a list for each combo box. Then click on the combobox in the VBA section
	  & go to 'RowSource' & type in 'Lists!<cell>:<cell>' for the range containing the values


Next Challenge: Format the DOTS board by change cell colors & creating a range dynamically

	> First Steps:
		>> Define variables that will store the input for each option on the setup screen
		>> Go to Formulas -> Name Manager & define a new name called DataStart

	DONE!

Functionality added 10.21:
	> Added names: can take input & output it onto the game board
			>> Define Cell Names in the Name Manager under the Formulas tab
			>> Select a range & set it to the created Name variable

Next Challenge: Create Game Manager Module

	> Need to figure out how to create the basic loop that runs the game &
		what the flow of the program should look like. The most basic first step
		I can think of is alternating player turns.

	> Re-doing my approach to the Game Board
			>> Use cells as dots! Duh! Borders are stupid
			>> Column Width for Dot cells = 1 & Row Height = 10
					>>> Should be able to programatically set those format values
			>> Select the ranges with the dots - For the vertical ranges add border on left & right
			>> For Horizontal range add Upper & Lower borders
